Fenix v0.1
==========

Typescript MVVM framework for use in HTML5 web application development.

Fenix enables developers to use the MVVM pattern in their HTML5 web applications using Typescript.
It is a lightweight framework with which single page applications can be created easily.

Fenix works with the following main principles:

- MVVM design pattern.
- binders for linking views to viewmodels.
- templates for displaying lists.
- routes for navigation purposes.
- datacontexts, executioncontexts and bindingcontexts.

To be a little more specific:

- create Typescript viewmodels and HTML views, including nested views.
- use oneway/twoway deep-binding to link view elements to viewmodel properties or methods.
- comes with 10+ binders out of the box like labelbinder, textbinder, visibilitybinder and many more.
- can be extended by creating your own application specific binders.
- display lists of objects using templates. Nested templates are supported.
- navigate to different parts of your application using routes processed by a navigator class.
- supports a progress indicator and message bar for each view.
- 100% written in Typescript.
- depends only on JQuery.

How to start:

- download the ZIP file and extract it somewhere on your harddisk.
- open the Example.sln solution file located in the Example folder in Visual Studio 2013.
- build and run the solution.

Important remarks:

- I'm developing Fenix as part of a large web application at the moment.
- Fenix is very experimental right now; there is much room for improvement.
- the example only shows a few basic functions; a lot more is possible with Fenix.
- all comments/suggestions for improvement are much appreciated!

Kind regards,
