Fenix v0.1
==========

Lightweight Typescript MVVM framework for use in HTML5 web application development.

Fenix enables developers to use the MVVM pattern in their HTML5 web applications using Typescript.

Fenix provides the following main principles:

- MVVM design pattern.
- binders for linking views to viewmodels.
- templates for displaying lists.
- routes for navigation purposes.
- datacontexts, executioncontexts and bindingcontexts.

To be a little more specific:

- create Typescript viewmodels and HTML views, including nested views.
- use oneway/twoway deep-binding to link view elements to viewmodel properties or methods.
- comes with 10+ binders out of the box like labelbinder, textbinder, visibilitybinder and many more.
- can be extended by creating your own application specific binders.
- display lists of objects using templates. Nested templates are supported.
- navigate to different parts of your application using routes processed by a navigator class.
- 100% written in Typescript.
- depends only on JQuery.

How to start:

- download the ZIP file and extract it somewhere on your harddisk.
- open the Example.sln solution file located in the Example folder in Visual Studio 2013.
- build and run the solution.

Remarks:

- I'm developing Fenix as part of a large web application at the moment.
- the example only shows a few basic functions; a lot more is possible with Fenix.
- I'm looking for feedback; all comments/suggestions for improvement are much appreciated!

Kind regards,
Jeroen Commandeur
